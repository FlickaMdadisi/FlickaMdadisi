## ⚡ Funfact
<!--STARTS_HERE_QUOTE_README-->
<i>❝
In 2014, a missing woman on a vacation in Iceland was found in a search party for herself. A missing tourist in the Eldgja Canyon was found in the search party tasked to locate her. She was last seen in the tour bus nearing the volcanic canyon. However, when she changed out of her clothes, she was reported missing. The search progressed from evening until the wee hours of the morning. The tourist group – and likely the tourist herself – were in for the surprise of their lives when they found the missing person in the search party itself. ❞</i>
